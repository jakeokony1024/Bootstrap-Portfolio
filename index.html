                <p class="card-text">Hello! my name is Jacob Okony and I was born in Aurora Colorado, but I grew up in
                    Michigan as my parents
                    moved back to where they were from after three years. I
                    spent the next 19 years going to school, playing music, drawing and creating things. I had a great
                    childhood, and was blessed with many things.
                    I never quite figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I had to get a job to pay for the
                    things I needed and wanted. I found restaurant work to just
                    come naturally, and moved up in the ranks quickly, always working hard and having great attention to
                    detail and thoroughness.</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    I came to Austin Texas in 2010 to pursue a music career, but found out that there was a ton of
                    competition. I fell back into restaurant work as it was easy to get
                    a job at a restaurant. I helped open <a href="http://www.haymakerbars.com/"
                        target="_blank">Haymaker</a>
                    in 2013, and became the Sous Chef in 2016. I have worked hard to get where I
                    am, but want more for myself and am ready to make a career change that will benefit myself and my
                    fiance.
